# Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. It analyzes customer demographics and behavioral data to identify factors that contribute to churn and build a predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of customer information, including:
- Demographic details (age, gender, marital status, education level, etc.)
- Financial information (account balance, credit card type, income category, etc.)
- Customer behavior (transaction history, number of dependents, tenure, etc.)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution of features and identifying key trends.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features for training the model.
4. **Model Training**: Applying machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to predict churn.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The model provides insights into key factors affecting customer churn and helps businesses take proactive measures to retain customers. The final predictions and performance metrics are available in the notebook.
